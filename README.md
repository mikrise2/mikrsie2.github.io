# "BugWorld" project

This project is an implementation of the first BugWorld sprint and uses the following technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The application is a single-page application where the HTML content changes dynamically based on user actions. The main interaction logic is stored in the index.js file.

## Application functionality

The application allows setting BugWorld parameters and starting the game. To use the application correctly, it is necessary to load all the required files and enter all the necessary data. The correctness of the input is checked to ensure proper functioning of the application. Additionally, interfaces have been added for the Game Logic diagram. Switching between pages works exactly as stated in the documentation.
